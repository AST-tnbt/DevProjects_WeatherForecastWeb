## Description

Hi there! I'm Tin!

This project is the result of using my recently-learned React skills.

I tried to generate a good app from a clean code perspective. However, I know that there are a lot of thinks that can be improved like the usage of context hook, create custom component to reuse templates for UI, etc.

Any feedback is welcome!

## Tech/framework used

Built with React.js, Vite and TailWind.
